Welcome to my website! My name is Shu Liu; I am a Hedrick Assistant Adjunct Professor in the Department of Mathematics at UCLA.

My research focuses on scientific computing, numerical analysis, and machine learning, with an emphasis on efficient, scalable algorithms for partial differential equations and beyond:
* Design numerical methods with accuracy guarantees for simulating Wasserstein geometric flows.
* Primal-dual algorithms for numerical PDEs and optimal transport problems, including classical and machine learning methods.
In addition, I am also interested in sampling and optimal control problems on graphs.
