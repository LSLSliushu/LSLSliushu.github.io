Welcome to my website! My name is Shu Liu; I am a Hedrick Assistant Adjunct Professor in the Department of Mathematics at UCLA. I graduated from the Computational Science & Engineering program at Georgia Institute of Technology under the supervision of Dr.Haomin Zhou. Pease find my CV here 'http://LSLSliushu.github.io/files/HamiltonianFlowOnGraph.pdf'.

My research focuses on scientific computing, numerical analysis, and machine learning, with an emphasis on efficient, scalable algorithms for partial differential equations and beyond:
* Design numerical methods with accuracy guarantees for simulating Wasserstein geometric flows.
* Primal-dual algorithms for numerical PDEs and optimal transport problems, including classical and machine learning methods.

In addition, I am also interested in sampling and optimal control problems on graphs.
