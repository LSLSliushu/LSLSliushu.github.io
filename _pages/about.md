I am driven to understand how evolutionary mechanisms such as natural selection, are involved in the survival of species and human health. During my phd @[David Enard lab](https://enardlab.com/), using population genetic methods and focusing on proteins, I explored how the adaptation process is connected to human diseases and how adaptation against viruses. I am currently working on inferring the selection of non-coding mutations in humans using simulation methods and population genetic theory as a postdoc researcher with [Kirk Lohmueller](https://lohmueller.eeb.ucla.edu/people/).
