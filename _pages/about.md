I am driven to understand how natural selection influences species' survival and human health. During my phd @[David Enard lab](https://enardlab.com/), I explored how adaptation connects to human Mendelian diseases and how human proteins evolve in response to viral infections. These previous works focused on adaptation in protein-coding genes or proteins. However, over 90% of the human genome is non-coding, and non-coding mutations are prevalently associated with complex diseases. How is natural selection in non-coding regions? To learn more about this question, I am currently working on inferring the selection of non-coding mutations in humans using simulation methods and population genetic theory as a postdoc researcher with [Kirk Lohmueller](https://lohmueller.eeb.ucla.edu/people/).
