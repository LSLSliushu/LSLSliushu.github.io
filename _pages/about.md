My name is Shu Liu. I am a Hedrick Assistant Adjunct Professor in the Department of Mathematics at UCLA. I graduated from the Computational Science & Engineering program at Georgia Institute of Technology under the supervision of Dr.Haomin Zhou. Here is my [CV](http://LSLSliushu.github.io/files/cv.pdf).

My research focuses on scientific computing, numerical analysis, and machine learning, with an emphasis on efficient, scalable algorithms for partial differential equations and beyond:
* Design numerical methods with accuracy guarantees for simulating Wasserstein geometric flows.
* Primal-dual algorithms using natural gradients for numerical PDEs and optimal transport problems, including classical and machine learning methods.

In addition, I am also interested in sampling and optimal control problems on graphs.
