My name is Shu Liu. I am an assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics at Florida State University. Before that, I was a Hedrick Assistant Adjunct Professor in the Department of Mathematics at UCLA. 
I obtained my Ph.D. from the Computational Science & Engineering program at Georgia Institute of Technology in 2022 under the supervision of Dr. Haomin Zhou. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Zhejiang University in 2016. 

Here is my [CV](http://LSLSliushu.github.io/files/cv.pdf).

My research focuses on scientific computing, numerical analysis, and machine learning, with an emphasis on efficient, scalable algorithms for partial differential equations and beyond:
* Design numerical methods with accuracy guarantees for simulating Wasserstein geometric flows.
* Primal-dual algorithms using natural gradients for numerical PDEs and optimal transport problems, including classical and machine learning methods.

In addition, I am also interested in sampling and optimal control problems on graphs.

Feel free to contact me (sliu11[at]fsu[dot]edu) if you are interested in my research!
